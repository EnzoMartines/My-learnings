My-learnings
I'll be posting everything that i learn and made here :D
Some of these i made myself, some not, the one's that i made generally, have a english VAR, FUNCTION or COMMAND. You are probably asking yourself why don't i made all the archives right? It's because when i started, i didn't know that programming isn't about learning 100 differents languages, but learning how to solve 1,000,000 problems in 7 languages, i discovered this after doing some searches in youtube and a bunch of other good things
